Streams in nodejs are used to read or write data sequentially. When we have to handle 
and manipulate streaming data, we use streams.

4 types of streams:
-   Writable -> used to write data sequentially
-   Readable -> used to read data sequentially
-   Duplex -> used to read and write data sequentially
-   Transorm - used to modify data while reading or writing

Like event, many built in modules use streaming interface. Streams extend event emitter class.
